### Challenge #12 for UT Austin Full-Stack web development bootcamp

## User Story

The joy of back end development continues as I was intoduced to SQL and database a couple days ago and the goal was to manipulate data in a SQL database using JavaScript(Node.js), inquirer, and MySQL and build a command-line application in order to manage my company's employee database. In order to better understand SQL I took this challenge to sharpen my new tools and be more familiar with SQL. Lately I've been feeling like the more I learn, the more I realize that I know nothing yet. Defining the functions for the questions was by far the most challenging in this project. There are a couple of future features that will be added later on so, stay tuned!

## Credits

I want to give a special shoutout to Leah, my instructor and Negin who is a teacher assistant at the moment for helping and supporting me when I got stuck and making more sense of how get and post routes work.
I would not have been able to make it if, it wasn't for my tutor Mr.Park. Team work makes the dream work!
And my friend/peer Chimeka
